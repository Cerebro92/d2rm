Later when the fees was to be paid principal Ms BIndu Gupta apologies and stated that it was a communication error and the fees will be 7500 for the first session. My complaint is that 1- the school should own up for the mistake they made. If the fee structure would have been informed unambigously ,many parents were planning and would have made self arrangement for one month and saved their had earned money. 2. Principal informed me that she cannot over-rule management decision, but she is the whole and sole responsible for management and could have given parent experience an edge over revenue for the school.

Even when the wall of parks were created people pressurize the workers to shorten the park. And park is now became a car parking area for which one villager is taking the parking cost( police man).

When I was about to put my daughter in school at her 3 yrs age, DPS  tag name came in my mind. My daughter studies in Delhi Public School, Newtown, Kolkata, since Nursery. Now she is in Class- One. But From the very beginning of this session she & her class teacher have some kind of mismatch. Whenever she has any query, her class teacher named Ms. Mandira Dasgupta uses unethical terms & says Go and sit in our desk. She always keeps punishing her and makes my daughter sit in the last bench. In this full academic year none of the days she could sit in the first bench. But the funniest thing is that, whenever I go & talk to her regarding this issue, her class teacher have no complain about my daughter. Ms. Mandira Dasgupta doesnt even bother to check her classwork properly. When she returns the classwork Copy at home, we have noticed that many right answers are marked wrong & many wrong class works are marked right in the copy. I dont want to complain about this teacher to the school authority as she might be marked by other teachers. I just look forward for her next year class teacher.

Call Ref No: 113363275 On 10/02/2012, the day of flight, to the utter surprise when I took a print out of the itinerary I realized that the flight timings of my connecting flight from KUL to DEL were changed from the actual schedule without prior notice and the transit time between the connecting flights was only for 10 minutes. . It came as a shock to me as I had never been informed about the change of timings. I was then forced to cancel my trip and I made a request to your airlines directly through a telephonic call to cancel my tickets as I had no other option because I was not getting any acceptable & reasonable response from the staff. I made a call to your Customer Care Centre on toll free number 18605008000 at around 14:00 Hrs on 10/02/2012 and discussed the matter with your executive Ms. Ritika & Anjali and Prashant. After keeping me on call for nearly 2 hours, I was informed that I should have contacted earlier and now nothing can be done and I would miss my connecting flight on my return anyway and the next available flight would be after 4-5 days. I was very disappointed because they gave me no satisfactory reply because to stay at the airport I was also required a visa and how I am supposed to get a visa at last moment. Your staff informed me that they have escalated the matter to the concerned department and I will receive a full refund of Rs. 40,950 within 30 days of acknowledgment of the request. I also requested Ms Sandhya, Revati to transfer the money in my HDFC savings A/c instead of the Credit Card I used to make the booking as it was my friends Credit Card which he lost afterwards. To this request your airline staff agreed and asked for my Saving Accounts details which I provided them at their request. However now its been more than 3 months and I am still waiting for the refund. You can see another example of negligence and disrespect of the matter by the staff of your airline. Grievances Due to the above incident and chain of events it is proven gross mistakes, negligence, poor customer service and lack of sincerity by your employees, following are my grievances which requires your kind attention for redressal from your good office and seek your intervention:- I booked my trip at least 3 months in advance and I had to cancel it on the day of departure just few hours before the take off. I was so upset because I had planned this trip in advance. All my plans were ruined because I was not informed about the change of schedule in advance and no good suggestions were given by your staff. They simply told me to cancel the flight as there were no options available. Me and my partner were in tears as we had planned so much this trip, I have gone through a lot of stress & trauma and and this brought me a lot of mental harassment as well. I received an email on 07/02/2012 that my flight from delhi to Kuala Lampur was rescheduled but I did not receive any mail or SMS regarding change of flight time for my return, . Had I been informed I not have cancel my flight. I am being a senior officer of an esteemed organization, wasting precious time of mine by involving in communicating and writing for explanation in the matter. In return I should be given a good compensation apart of the refund. Earlier I had no intention of taking this matter to court but now I consider I have to take a legal action because of the harassment that I am facing.

It is a bike battery which was purchased by the same dealer on 22-10-2012 but unfortunately it got a complaint on 1-june-2013, In this regard i had meet with your Hind motor dealer to know the fault in battery. Your dealer behavior was very rude regarding this complaint and he tried not to take complaint at first but when I insist and told the problem then he took the complaint and ready to send the battery to your branch office on 5-06-2012 for fault diagnosis. Your Ghaziabad branch office whose address is D-42 Patel Nagar II Ghaziabad-201001 Phone: 0120-4117951 Now my complaint is regarding your branch office work they had received the complained on 5-june-2013 but did not open the job up to 10-June 2013 when i insist the dealer two to three times personally then on dated 10-06-2013 the dealer send me at your branch office to know the position of my complaint with his assistance but I was surprised to see the status of my complaint that it was not opened till date that means that your branch office simply received the battery on 5-june-2013 and does nothing up to 10-june -2013.They had not even informed to dealer nor me(the customer). They simply sat quiet which is a wrong and absolute irresponsible behavior against the name and fame of your company. Is it your first class customer service??? When I want to inquire this why it happened then no senior officer was present to give answer after insisting with the worker available on the workshop I got the no of Mr. Shakil which is told as service engineer by the worker and his number is 9350529150 but unfortunately he was not able to reply satisfactory of my question on phone of not opening the job up to 10-june-2013 whereas he had received the complaint on 5-june-2013. Your branch office worker simply told that your battery is ok and advice me to take it to my home as it is working fine(Surprisingly without the specification of any engineer they decided it) Now I want to know the answer of two main question from your company officials:- (1) Why you had not take action on the branch manager who had not found in his office as I was told by other customer and even by your dealer that he usually not available in the office. (2) Is it the customer care of Exide to take the job from customer on 3-june-2013 and not opening the job up to 10-june -2012 and after asking the question for delay your dealer misbehave and your branch office simply told that battery is ok by simply charging it and returned to me. Will you able to give the answer of these question to a loyal customer of Exide. I hope any good official will see the matter and reply me soon regarding my complained. -- With Regards Mohit Saras DPS Ghaziabad MobileNo-9891389128</td><td>ComplaintBoard</td><td>Academics</td><td>Negative</td><td>2013/06/10</td></tr><tr><td style=\'width:50px\'><a href="http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/jee-main-2013-l254675/page/16#c1333442" target="_blank">http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/jee-main-2013-l254675/page/16#c1333442</a><br/></td><td>DPS</td><td>as many of us have turned 18 i request all of you that we should never vote for congress ever in our lives...these are the guys who ruined our careers...and also tell your parents and relatives to do the same..they just know to how play vote bank politics and teach others to be corrupt and live corrupt and even use the name like Mahatma Gandhi to win votes ...but look what they have done, lost their most precious thing i.e OUR VOTES...</td><td>ComplaintBoard</td><td>Fees</td><td>Negative</td><td>2013/07/09</td></tr><tr><td style=\'width:50px\'><a href="http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/relaxo-footwear-l48363.html#c1353608" target="_blank">http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/relaxo-footwear-l48363.html#c1353608</a><br/></td><td>DPS</td><td>Dear concern This is inform to you.

Roads have got washed off already with one week. I was quite shocked as while construction of GT road was going on the recently constructed road was re-constructed where as the road leading towards Bulandshehar from chaudhary mod was in bad state and was constructed till Bhatia mod flyover and the road from Bhatia mod flyover to Laal kuan is in very bad shape. Whereas the road leading to Ghantaghar from laal kaun was in very good state earlier was re constructed and after reconstruction you can find new pot holes on road near laal kaun and in front of shankar laal hospital. This is the complete was of money and the tax payers money is not properly been used. Please look into this matter ASAP.

As it is connected to GT Road so there are heavy vehicles also coming and poor condition of roads result in traffic jam. We have tried each and possible way to focus your attention towards that road. We have written complaints and also went on strike but of no use. So kindly pay your attention towards this and if not then do tell us what way should we try so that we can get that road in a proper condition. I will be highly obliged if you will find a way to our problem.

Later they asked me where I want to go I told them Baner, they asked for 60 rupees(by meter its 40) I said no, then I asked them why they didn\'t let me take that auto who was going by meter, so they told me that I should keep walking and take another auto from road and they meet people like me everyday. Then I told them that I will complain about them by making a phone signal so they started threatening me and shouting at me very aggressively. Hope you act on this complaint of mine as if they can threaten someone like this in broadday light I am scared to think what they will do at night time when some is alone or with women. This is not one off incident auto drivers v often act like a mafia at auto stand. No auto want to run a short distance, minimum fare they ask is 30 rupees while meter is 17 rupees.

The cbse resource person said 90% of the questions would be from the text book. I found just one textbook question. All the questions were application based. There are some below average student too. You should think of that while setting the paper. It would be nice if you make the physics correction lenient. Maths....either the correction should be very lenient or there should be an improvement exam. I prefer the latter.

It is a bad experience with Honda because after 2 days only, there was a problem in self start every morning. I usually think that it will resolve after first servicing. I went for the servicing of Activa at VD Autowheels,Plot no-66,Sector-3,Behind DPS school,Dwarka,New Delhi dated on 12th April,2015 and i have told them regarding the self start problem and also told it to Capt. P.S. Verma Service Manager. Everyone including Capt. P.S. Verma said that do start Activa in the morning from kick. I asked them to give me this statement in written but they denied. I never thought that I ll get this kind of a response. Apart from it, the servicing was so poor, they don\'t even have a clean clothes to clean Activa. After servicing, I do not feel with smooth driving. In future, I ll never go with Honda products as it was a very bad experience.

I would not like to disclose my name but would like to throw some lights on the schools inner environment, so that it gives a clear picture to the teachers who have thought of applying and would at the same time would like to inform the DPS society. I even joined the school with lots of dream but was shattered soon after few months. I started to realise that this is definitely not a place, at least not for me to survive. I have worked as a teacher with various schools before but I am compelled to say that working with DPS (North Kolkata) was worst. A school should have a wonderful principal to work with, who would be there to co-operate, to motivate and to boost our skills. However, this was the first principal I have worked is just the opposite. Yes, Mrs Tinku Shrivastava, she is a mental patient I would assume. Her behaviour with the teachers is extremely rude, which at times makes the teachers to cry. She is always after the teachers and threats them each and every time on getting them fired. This is absolutely not expected out of a principal. A principal should be able to understand the problem of his/her staffs and accordingly stand beside them. Here, she has always been against those teachers who dedicate their entire time sincerely for the school. She un-necessarily harasses the teachers in many ways and find out ways to treat them rudely. Well, I must not say its rude but her behaviour is totally insane. It is very surprising why DPS Society or the trustees are not taking any steps against her, and that is the reason she is doing whatever she likes with the teachers and this is becoming worst. She never praises the teachers and keep herself extremely busy in finding out faults rather than motivating. While in meetings, she uses abusive languages and in fact talks about casts. She herself being a Bengali, talks nonsense about Bengalis. She, I hope is a learned person and such human beings generally set examples so that others can learn from them. I was compelled to leave the school because of her. None of the teachers are happy there and are tolerating her only because jobs are not easily available. She says whatever she likes and does not care about anyone. There is nothing to learn from such a person. She is absolute waste.

Chief Minister of Delhi, HRD Minister to take urgent measures to stop the malpractice of Presidium School Sector 16B, Dwarka, New Delhi. The school has been increasing the Tuition fee, Transport Charges, Annual & Development Charges by steep 10%. On asking the break up of the charges, the school does not bother to reply. There is no further scope of development in the school so why do we pay the charges. The annual charges are payable only in the first year of admission whereas the school is charging every year. Also there are uniforms and books which are sold on sky-high prices as compared to the market. As a middle class earner, our salaries does not get increment of 10% so why are we slapped with over charging by the school every year. There is no regulatory body to check the accounts and question the school management as where are they using these funds. Despite the order from the Delhi Government to roll back the fee hike this year to all the schools in Delhi, Presidium School is adamant and compelling parents to pay the hiked amount only. We have written several emails to the Directorate of Education, Dy. Chief Minister, HRD Minister but there has been no response. Whereas the schools like DPS at various locations, Ryan International, Queen\'s Valley, Maxfort, K. R. Mangalam etc have rolled back fees and issued circular to the parents to pay as per the last year. We are yet to hear the same from Presidium. I want the Ministry to ask Presidium School to roll back arbitrary and unjustified fee hike, bring transparency in the system, appoint PTA based on biennially elected members, abolish charging Annual Charges every year, give accountable reason for charging development charges wherein there is no scope of further development.</td><td>ComplaintBoard</td><td>Academics</td><td>Negative</td><td>2016/04/29</td></tr><tr><td style=\'width:50px\'><a href="http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/kavitha-mehra-039-s-online-profits-course-l248792.html#c2101138" target="_blank">http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/kavitha-mehra-039-s-online-profits-course-l248792.html#c2101138</a><br/></td><td>DPS</td><td>Its a F***k Website..

My daughter gets shortlisted in Amity International School Mayur Vihar. We get the call from them to deposite the fee in the form of a Pay Order. Before getting to their school we gave it a lot of thought as the distance from our house to school is over 12 Kms. We prepared the DD and get to the school on very last day for admission that is 30th March. We submitted the forms and DD to the finance person Mr Surinder Bisht. Our file has been forwarded to the Principal Mrs Sarita Agarwal. In half an hour we are called by the Principal for an interaction in her room In our interaction with her, she asked us why we want our daughter to travel such a long distance. We realized the fact and decided not to go for the admission of our daughter in their school. We get to the finance person Mr Surinder Bisht to take our DD back. Unfortunately he declined to return the DD. When we compliant the same to the Principal she called him up. We were kept outside during their discussion. Finally Mr Surinder Bisht confirmed us that our amount will get refunded in a week time and only Rs 700 will be deducted from the amount we submitted. We submitted a DD of Rs 46394. Now the problem is I am chasing Mr Bisht in person and chasing the Principal on email but there is no response at all from their side. Now I am having very little hope that I will get my amount refunded. Hence escalating this case to you now. Can you please help me in this case on a very urgent basis please. This is a pure case of harresment. I am provoked to take legal action against its chairperson Mrs Amita Chauhan. Amity is having very poor Internal Governance and is not at all Parent friendly.

They have tested the students on a maths paper/science paper which was far above the standard of an ordinary student. None of the questions were from NCERT which is the standard norm for setting a paper in Boards. The paper was tough for even the bright students of the School let alone weak students. During Feb/March students were called for extra classes during which students who had not faired well in SA1 were called. Students continuously not fairing well in a subject like Maths were not called, moreover never till the past 10 yrs had School complained abt the fact that students were not fairing well. In my opinion a student should be good in Bascs for a subject like Maths, this had been pointed out by myself several times to the school during the juniormost foundation laying stage of the classes. All thru my daughter had been rated as good just because she was good at extra curricular activities and would have to cater to extra activities like decorating the class board,etc. Never had the teachers in the junior classes laid stress on building up the basics. Amity as a school (in particular East Delhi Branch) had encouraged students to come for extra classes. Was it the only duty of parents to send students for private tutions despite paying a heavy amt of fee per quarter to school. Besides this the admissions for Class XI were imposed as well as the payment of the fee for the first quarter (which is to the tune of 50,000/-) an amt hard enough for any serving class. When the Principal was approached for this by me she appraised me of the fact that the syllabus for Class XI was so vast that it should be completed on time and the students would even be tested on that before vacations. When I argued over the fact that it would incur lot of burden on both child (psychologically) and parents (financially) she said that this was our personal decision. She was simply imposing Synchro study (a private coaching school for Science students) and CBSE Excel (A new initiative for extra classes for Commerce students). She did not even let us discuss these issues at the first meeting after Class X so that there would be no ruccus. When I appraised her of the fact that CBSE rules allow all this she went to extent of saying that if I was so influential that I know people in CBSE I was free to change school. Now I fear that the grades of the students shown in the results would not be a fair judgement (because of lack of good faculty particularly in the foundation laying classes) resulting in no good hold of students over various subjects. Moreover with the fact that students in the other branches were being tested on papers which were already discussed with them in Class X before exams, the results of all students would be unfair. Please look into the detailed results of SA1 & comparison with SA2 (particularly students who had not performed well in SA1 & may perform very well in SA2). It was communicated to the students that they would be compensated during finals, just for the reason that the school has to reflect a good result in CLASS X to be able to live upto its name PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY AND HELP ALL THE HONEST STUDENTS & SAVE HARD EARNED MONEY OF THE PARENTS</td><td>ComplaintBoard</td><td>Academics</td><td>Negative</td><td>2014/05/20</td></tr><tr><td style=\'width:50px\'><a href="http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/amity-international-school-vasundhara-sector-6-l386986.html#c1697117" target="_blank">http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/amity-international-school-vasundhara-sector-6-l386986.html#c1697117</a><br/></td></td><td>Amity_International</td><td>We have discontinued our two children from Amity International school, Vasundhra, Sector-6 and have applied for Transfer Certificate which is required for admission of our children in another school.

This year he appeared for class X exams which was non-board. I would like to bring to your kind notice that school is forcefully alloting the streams to students. Although, the school had taken the information before hand to know the children\'s intrest. still they have decided even before the result is out that who will go to which stream and there is no criteria of alloting the streams. they have given under the influence of powerful parents...............this i can say because students who scored less than what my son scored have been alloted science. when i inquired with the school they were not ready to listen to us and they alloted humanities to my son. on what grounds only god knows. if we talk about his CGP he scored 7.6 in SA1 and expecting much more in final exams. they says he cannot do science and commerce but my question is my son never scored good marks in Social science and he is not even intrested in studying that subject then why is forced to study the stream in which he is not at all intrested. secondly, school is also not ready to disclose on what grounds they have alloted the streams because students who have scored 6 CGP are alloted Science!!!! and when i enquired from the coordinator mam she said we will not allot him any other subject because his father was a part of protest in 2008 in which parents protested for the fee hike. i would like to bring to your kind notice mam, my husband was not the only one who protested for the fee hike with him 1500 other parents were also there. secondly, is this the criteria of taking revenge. how can they take the revenge with my son because his father was a part of parents associaation????? in continuation to that conversation she also tried to convince me by saying that they have also considered the discipline. what discipline they are talking about i really dont know becasue in last 8 years i have never got any complaint from school about any disciplenary issue. and we have never ever got any complaint from school. they are just taking revenge and playing with the students future/career. i can shift him in any other school but just wanted to bring to your kind notice about the injustice happened with my son and many other students. how can school authority without looking at grades force students to study in which they are not intrested. they should be given chance to studay whaterver they want to .....only then they will be able to make their future bright as well as make our country proud. I request you to meet Ms. Smriti Mam or any of his department head along with many other parents of the same school to make sure this injustice do not happen with any other child in future also.

Since 13 November till 12 December 2013 I did not get any reply, feedback from your department. At the first visit to campus on 13 November I was told I would be getting 5 marks grace as there is a possibility however after sending 18 remienders I did not get any reply. I was given a number to contact however that number is always busy or no one picks up the phone. I dont know how positively you are going to consider my email. I have visited to campus yesterday spoken with the same person he was not able answer me why he could not check the status in one month. Now he says I will have to reappear for the exam. Is is possible to prepare for maths in 2 nights as the examination date is 15th November. It was very disappointed for me. Yesterday morning when i have spoken with the concern person regarding the issue again he was saying you must get 5 marks grace. The reason why I am writing you is, I am the single earning member of my family I am working with HCL Technology few months back I have got the promotion to next level at that time I told them I will submit my degree by the mid of December. If I do not submit my degree either i will be demoted else I will be ask to leave with in a month. I will have to look after new job. I request you please look into issue and fix it for me. I was not expecting this kind of mis leading guidence from Amity University. Last time I had interaction with you in 2010 regarding the late fee as my Mom was hospitalized and I could not pay the fee on time. However I had to pay late fee. It\'s my humble request kindly look into this and fix it for me as I am suffering a lot.

My daughters are studying at Ryan International School, Kundalahalli, Bangalore, since last couple of years, elder daughter has completed 7th standard and the younger daughter has completed MON-III during the academic year 2011-12. We are moving out of country to USA, Wisconsin for my career opportunities, which is an unplanned move. My US VISA papers got approved during the last week of May 2012 and had provided all the supporting documents on my US VISA to school principal on June 2nd. However, they are insisting me to pay the first term fee for both the children. They are very adamant and not taking any responsibility to discuss further on this. Always, the principal response is that, should have applied for Transfer certificate way back in April 2012, failing which would attract first term fee to be paid by the parents though they are not studying any more for the academic year 2012-13. I had requested for TC on 2nd June and till now I have no response and the school had re-opened on June 4th. Please help me. I can be reached at 09980325928 for further details. Following are the academic details of each student: Elder Daughter\'s details: Student Name: Harshita Reddy Class: 7th, J (Roll#: 9) Academic Year: 2011-12.

Only Skating is still on & that too in the school corridors. School ground is used for school bus parking, hence no place for kids to play sports. The teachers leave in the mid term as they are not paid on time. The power supply goes off for over an hour in a day and the kids have to suffer without fan/electricity in such scorching heat in the month of April in Mumbai. They have not even justified the hike in the fees for last 2 years. Just because parents pay the fees doesn\'t mean the Management takes advantage of the parents. They rush the syllabus so much that it becomes a burden on the kids to manage. For using the Computer Lab, they are charges Rs.1620/- per month, if they cannot afford the maintenance of the lab, might as well remove the subject of computer.

I visited Ryan International School, a day and found the same after a small inquiry. When I asked about the admission process and fee structures etc, instead of telling the desired information they pointed me to check notice board, if you are eligible then ask an inquiry and we will respond you accordingly. After checking the notice board I found, for an admission in class K.G. I have to pay rupees more than 1 Lakh including one month tuition fee (tuition fee is around 4500 per month that is too much). I was able to pay such money but I do not like such kind of school\'s attitude and environment.

But for next year the agreement is not renewed & there was no discussion happen on agreement renewal & hike in rent for second year. But 3rd year myself decided to give 10% hike along with previous year & informed the same to Owner, same was paid thereafter. I looked for a new house in July\'14 end & informed owner one month in advance that August end I will be vacating the house (its verbally & didn\'t gave any written letter, notice period mentioned as 3 months in agreement & I\'ve signed without reading the clause properly, its my mistake) I got the house painting done & fixed the minor damages on my expense, Now on 1st Sep\'14 , as per agreement I got the interior painting job done as it was when I moved to that house in April2011 after taking owner permission & asking their preferred paint & colour. Now owner complaining that painting work is not good, nobody will come to stay in this house & they again got the re-paint done themselves on 14th which was not informed to me ( I believe its done with the intention to get a new tenant for high rent & deduct the paining cost in my security deposit) & now delaying in returning advance amount by giving some weird reasons. I just want to know Is what landlord doing is correct? Since the rental agreement is lapsed 2 years back & no renewal done Can I insist owner to refund the advance for 1 month notice which I\'ve given.

Chief Minister of Delhi, HRD Minister to take urgent measures to stop the malpractice of Presidium School Sector 16B, Dwarka, New Delhi. The school has been increasing the Tuition fee, Transport Charges, Annual & Development Charges by steep 10%. On asking the break up of the charges, the school does not bother to reply. There is no further scope of development in the school so why do we pay the charges. The annual charges are payable only in the first year of admission whereas the school is charging every year. Also there are uniforms and books which are sold on sky-high prices as compared to the market. As a middle class earner, our salaries does not get increment of 10% so why are we slapped with over charging by the school every year. There is no regulatory body to check the accounts and question the school management as where are they using these funds. Despite the order from the Delhi Government to roll back the fee hike this year to all the schools in Delhi, Presidium School is adamant and compelling parents to pay the hiked amount only. We have written several emails to the Directorate of Education, Dy. Chief Minister, HRD Minister but there has been no response. Whereas the schools like DPS at various locations, Ryan International, Queen\'s Valley, Maxfort, K. R. Mangalam etc have rolled back fees and issued circular to the parents to pay as per the last year. We are yet to hear the same from Presidium. I want the Ministry to ask Presidium School to roll back arbitrary and unjustified fee hike, bring transparency in the system, appoint PTA based on biennially elected members, abolish charging Annual Charges every year, give accountable reason for charging development charges wherein there is no scope of further development.</td><td>ComplaintBoard</td><td>Academics</td><td>Negative</td><td>2016/04/29</td></tr><tr><td style=\'width:50px\'><a href="http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/ryan-internation-school-st-xavior-039-s-higher-secondary-school-l495130.html#c2093158" target="_blank">http://www.complaintboard.in/complaints-reviews/ryan-internation-school-st-xavior-039-s-higher-secondary-school-l495130.html#c2093158</a><br/></td></td><td>Ryan International</td><td>Sir, I would like to inform you, my daughter was studying in 11th class in st. xavior\'s( ICSE board) under banner of ryan international( CBSE).

During the whole period they did not clear about CBSE rule : 1. test marks will not add, theory & practical separate pass compulsory,pass will be on avg basis. 2. After passing the 10th exam from st. xavior\'s , ISCE board ( around 75%) , I want to withdraw from st. xavior\'s & admit to any other CBSE . They have told you will not need to leave school we are doing CBSE also in our school. Those students whose want to take admition in other school they have stopped & arrange single section in his school . day by day they give warning we will send to ryan building & after sometimes they have informed you have to wear ryan school dress. While st. xavior\'s( ICSE) teachers were teaching . As previous , they were taking test & exam same as xavior\'s ( ICSE ) pattern. But on result time they applied CBSE rule neither they have added test mark not earlier clear to parent about CBSE rule. When I have asked class teacher , he has told I was also unaware of CBSE rule. Just sorry. I met principal regarding this attitude they have informed We will talk to management & wait for 2 to 3 days for retest . After waiting few days I have given the later to principal st. xavior\'s as well ryan principle. Then we have taken the TC. We are attaching correspondence to you also. Due to this incident more than 50 % student detained in only one section has lost one important year including my daughter . Due to these types of school some student left the study on early age.

This is totally illegal. I have sent an email to the Regional Centre, Bangalore regarding this but no action is taken. So I am forced to put the complaint on this.

Moreover the School has started classes for class 11 in all streams before the declaration of results. The principal\'s attitude seems above the prime mister and president as he is never available in any contact number provided and to the surprise he also fled his office on 20th April when guardians were angry to take admission for their ward .

I had a suitcase with me for luggage. The normal fare for the trip is Rs 11 per person but the Auto drover of WB 11 4042 asked for Rs. 33 in lieu of the luggage. I agreed but he insisted on seating another person in the back seat and having me carry the luggage on my legs during the journey. I resisted and asked him to give me the entire seat of three as I was already paying him the fare for three people, he asked me to leave his auto and asked the others not to take us their autos as well. I was furious and asked the local civic volunteer to help out but the driver bullied him away. Left with no option I had to catch the bus. I live in Kanpur but the kind of behaviour I witnessed there was the worst I have seen. The drivers need to understand that if they are providing a service then it should be dignified and they should not come down to the level of hooligans.I would be happy if you could take some step to stop this rohue behaviour which troubles commuters on that route.

It allows you to identify a symbol and also draw circuits. It is a handy reference and has some symbols that have never had a symbol before, such as a Flashing LED and electroluminescence panel. Once you have identified a symbol on a diagram you will need to refer to specification sheets to identify each lead on the actual component. The symbol does not identify the actual pins on the device. It only shows the component in the circuit and how it is wired to the other components, such as input line, output, drive lines etc. You cannot relate the shape or size of the symbol with the component you have in your hand or on the circuit-board. Sometimes a component is drawn with each pin in the same place as on the chip etc. But this is rarely the case. Most often there is no relationship between the position of the lines on the circuit and the pins on the component. Thats what makes reading a circuit so complex. This is very important to remember with transistors, voltage regulators, chips and so many other components as the position of the pins on the symbol are not in the same places as the pins on the component and sometimes the pins have different functions according to the manufacturer. Sometimes the pin numbering is different according to the component, such as positive and negative regulators. You must to refer to the manufacturers specification sheet to identify each pin, to be sure you have identified them correctly. Colin Mitchell 1N4001 to 1N4007 Silicon Power Rectifiers The following are subminiature general purpose power rectifiers for low power applications Electrical Characteristics Specifications Instantaneous Voltage Drop @ forward current = 1 A 1.1V Absolute Maximum Ratings Peak Repetitive Reverse Voltage 1N4001 50V 1N4002 100V 1N4003 200V 1N4004 400V 1N4005 600V 1N4006 800V 1N4007 1000V Their value will depend on the current and the degree of smoothing required. As a general guide, if the current being drawn from a supply is high, the size of the smoothing capacitor will need to be large (around 2500uF or larger) if the hum level is to be kept down to a respectable level. It must also not be forgotten that all of these circuits are \'unregulated\' i.e. as the load increases from zero to maximum the output voltage will drop due to the transformer voltage dropping under load and losses across the diodes - and the storage capacity of smoothing capacitors. Example Say for example we want a power supply to give 9V at 1 A. We could use a M21 55 transformer which is rated at 1 A. If we use a bridge rectifier and the 9V tapping the output voltage will be:- VDC= 1.41 XVAC - 1.41 X9V = 12.69V Peak ( 9V at 1A load) Loading and Nominal Voltage One thing to be aware of with this type of power supply circuit is the voltages given by the formulas are nominal only. Because the actual output voltage of a transformer varies according to its load, the DC output of the power supply will also vary. As well as this, there is a voltage drop across the diodes which will vary according to load. If you need a very precise voltage, the best solution is to use one of the regulated power supply circuits shown in the zener Diode and Voltage Regulator sections of this ebook. You will see that most regulated circuits use one of the circuits above to produce unregulated DC, then regulate it to a consistent voltage that is independent of the load. OA91 General purpose germanium signal diode The OA91 is a small signal germanium point contact diode. It is suitable for a wide range of RF detector and small signal rectifying applications. Specifications IP Forward current 50mA VR Reverse Voltage 90V Vp, Forward voltage drop @ IP = 10mA 1.05V @lF = 0.1mA 0.1V Crystal Set The crystal set consists of a tuned circuit which selects the wanted station or frequency, and a detector, which separates the information (music, speech etc.) from the radio transmission. The audio voltage produced is an exact replica of the sound from the radio station. The detector diode rectifies the incoming signal, leaving a half wave radio signal which varies in amplitude with the audio signal. The fixed capacitor C2 shorts out or \'bypasses\' the RF signal, leaving only the audio. The circuit below is for a Crystal set using a readily available Ferrite rod and pre-wound aerial coil. RF Monitor Meter 1N4148 Silicon Signal Diode The 1N4148 is a general purpose signal diode suitable for a wide range of switching and low power rectifying purposes. It is equivalent to the 1N914. Features  Low Capacitance. 4pF at 0V  High breakdown voltage. 100V Specifications Capacitance VR=0, f= 1MHz 4pF Reverse Recovery Time 4nsec Rectification Efficiency 2.0V rms. f=100 MHz Absolute Maximum Ratings Breakdown Voltage 100V Working Inverse Voltage 75V DC Forward Current 300mA Maximum Total Dissipation at 25°C 500mW Zener Diodes Zener diodes are used primarily as voltage references. They are devices which maintain an almost constant voltage across them despite various changes in circuit conditions. Unlike conventional diodes, zener diodes are deliberately intended to be used with the anode connected to a negative potential (or 0v) and the cathode connected to the positive potential. When connected in this manner, zener diodes have a very high resistance below a certain critical voltage (called the zener voltage). If this voltage is exceeded, the resistance of the zener drops to a very low level. When used in this region, essentially constant voltage will be maintained across the Zener, despite quite large changes in the applied currents. This is illustrated graphically in the figure below. It can be seen that beyond the zener voltage, the reverse voltage remains practically constant despite changes in reverse current. Because of this, Zener diodes may be used to provide a constant voltage drop, or reference voltage. The actual voltage available from a zener diode is temperature dependent. The Basic Circuit The Basic Voltage regulator circuit is shown below. It uses only one resistor and one zener diode. This is called a SHUNT REGULATOR. See SERIES REGULATOR below. If the Zener diode is rated at 5.6V and the applied voltage is 8.0V, then with no load applied, the output voltage across R1 will be 5.6V and the remaining 2.4V will be dropped across Rs, If the input voltage is changed to 9.0V, then the voltage across the Zener will remain at 5.6V. In practice, the voltage across the Zener will rise slightly due to the \'dynamic resistance of the zener. The resistor R1 represents an external load. When this load is connected, some of the current flowing through the zener will now pass through the load. The series resistor Rs is selected so that the minimum current passing through the zener is not less than that required for stable regulation. It is also necessary to ensure that the value of Rs is such that the current flow through the zener cannot exceed its specified power rating. This can be calculated by multiplying the zener voltage by the zener current. The design procedure is as follows:- 1) Specify the maximum and minimum load current, say 0mA and 10mA. 2) Specify the maximum and minimum supply voltages (say 12v) but ensure that the minimum supply voltage is always at least 1.5v higher than the zener voltage being used. 3) In the circuit shown the minimum zener current is 100µA. Thus the maximum zener current (which occurs when there is no load connected) is 10ma plus 100µA equals 10.1mA. 4) The series resistor must conduct 10.1mA at the lowest input supply voltage, so the minimum voltage drop across Rs will be 1.5v. Thus the value of Rs will be:- 1.5v / 10.1X10-3 = 148.5 ohms This could be changed to the nearest preferred value of 150 ohms. 5) At the maximum supply voltage (12v) the voltage across Rs is equal to the zener current times the series resistor. This is the maximum (worst case) zener current. To work out the resulting power dissipation, we multiply this current by the zener voltage. In this example this works out at:- Any zener over this in power rating would be suitable in this circuit. Temperature Drift in Zeners Typical zener diodes drift in their voltage at about +0.1%/°C at the higher voltages. At lower voltages this goes negative reaching -0.04%/°C at around 3.5v. This may be made use of in temperature sensing devices. The circuit below shows how a bridge consisting of two similar zener diodes and two resistors can indicate temperature differences when one zener is held at standard temperature and the other is subjected to the conditions to be monitored. If a 10v zener is used, it will have a temperature coefficient of +0.07%/°C giving a change of 7millivolts per degree C. Non Standard Voltages Non standard voltages can be ob¬tained by connecting zener diodes in series. The diodes need not have the same voltages since this arrange¬ment is self equalizing. Zener Noise Zener diodes generate noise voltages. These may vary between 10µV and 1mV depending on zener voltage and rating. This noise is easily suppressed by placing a 0.01 to 0.1µF capacitor across it. This reduces the noise voltage by a factor of at least 10. Zener Diode as a Calibration Signal When supplied with alternating current, the zener diode will limit both the negative and positive halves of the AC cycle. The waveform will be asymmetrical, since the zener will limit almost immediately in one direction, but will not limit until its zener voltage in the other direction. Increased Power Handling Although zeners can be paralleled for higher power operation, it is usually a better idea to use a series transistor with a zener reference. This configuration improves the power handling and also the regulation of the circuit by a factor equal to the current gain of the transistor. Constant Current Regulation This simple circuit maintains a constant current (within approx 10%). Over-voltage Protection The circuit below uses the zener as a \'fuseblower\'. The zener is selected so that under normal operation it is not conducting. If the circuit develops a fault and the power supply voltage rises above the zener voltage, the zener will come \'on\' and draw a heavy current, blowing the fuse. Improving temperature stability If better temperature stability is required than can be obtained with a single zener, a good trick is to use an ordinary forward biased silicon diode. This makes use of the fact that the forward voltage temperature coefficient of a silicon diode is approximately -2mV/°C. The temperature coefficient of the silicon diode and the zener diode cancel out, giving an almost temperature independent voltage reference. The use of the forward biased diode also allows \'trimming\' of zeners to voltages other than the preferred value available. A silicon diode when forward biased will have a voltage drop of 0.7v. When put in series with a zener it will increase the reference by this much. Thus a 6.2v zener plus a silicon diode will give a voltage of 6.9v. Dual Voltage Power Supply The circuit below uses zener diodes to give a split or dual power supply which is ideal for running ICs such as op-amps. The power input only needs to be an unregulated single rail DC source. When selecting Rs it should be remembered that the zener is the sum of the voltage of the two zeners. These two circuits show typical use of zeners in power supply circuits. The circuit below is designed to give increased current capacity. It will supply up to 1A with suitable heatsinking of the transistors. These two circuits show typical use of zeners in power supply circuits. The circuit below is designed to give increased current capacity. It will supply up to 1A with suitable heatsinking of the transistors. Semiconductor Devices The simplest type of semiconductor device is the diode. It has two electrodes, a cathode and an anode. II is formed from a junction of P and N type silicon. As shown below, when the diode is forward biased, by applying a negative voltage to the cathode (the N type silicon) and a positive voltage to the anode (the P type silicon) the diode conducts and has a very low resistance. If the voltage connections are reversed, the diode is said to be reversed biased and has a very high resistance. If another layer is added to the semiconductor junction, the resulting device becomes a bipolar transistor. The three layers of the device are the emitter, the collector and the base. In normal operation, the emitter to base junction is forward biased and the collector to base junction in the reverse direction. There are two types of transistor, NPN and PNP. The names relate to the \'sandwich\' structure of the two types of transistor. They are shown below. For practical purposes, the important difference between the two types of transistor is that in NPN transistors the current flows from emitter to collector. In PNP transistors the electrons flow from collector to emitter. Bipolar Transistors Bipolar Transistors are current amplifying devices. When a small signal current is applied at the input terminal (the base) of the bipolar transistor, an amplified reproduction of this signal appears at the output terminals (the collector). There are 3 useful way of connecting the input signal for amplification. Common Base Mode In this mode, the signal is introduced into the emitter-base circuit (Thus the base element is common to both the input and output circuits. In this mode, the input impedance is low (i.e. it puts a heavy load on the signal source). The output impedance is fairly high. This type of circuit gives voltage gain and slightly less than unity current gain. Commonly used as an impedance converter. Common Emitter Mode In this configuration, the signal is introduced into the base-emitter circuit. This arrangement has moderate input and output impedance. It gives both current and voltage gain. Current gain is measured by comparing the base current and the collector current and so is equivalent to HFE A very small change in base current produces a relatively large change in collector current. Depending on the type of transistor this will vary from 5-600. This is the most commonly used circuit, very often found in audio amplifiers. For an explanation of HFE see definition below. Common Collector Mode In this configuration, the signal is introduced into the base/collector circuit and is \'extracted\' from the emitter/collector circuit. The input impedance of this arrangement is high and the output impedance is low. The voltage gain is less than unity while the current gain is high. This configuration is used as an impedance matching device. Commonly called an emitter follower, it is also often used as a current amplifier in power supplies. Common Collector Mode Darlington Pair This arrangement is sensitive to temperature and varying gains of transistors. A better arrangement is shown above (b). This stabilizes the operating point of the transistor because an increase in collector current drops the collector voltage and thus decreases the base bias. Definitions Alpha (a) Gain In the common base mode, the emitter is the input electrode and the collector is the output electrode. The alpha is the ratio of the collector current lc to the emitter current IE. It is always less than 1. Beta current gain (hFE) In the common emitter mode, the base is the input terminal and the collector is the output terminal. The beta is the ratio of the collector current lc to the base current IB. Gain Bandwidth Product (fhfe) This is the frequency at which the alpha or beta (according to the type of circuit) drops to 0.707 times its 1 kHz value. Transition Frequency (fT) The frequency at which the small-signal forward current transfer ratio (common-emitter) falls to unity. Breakdown voltage This defines the voltage between two electrodes at which the current rises rapidly. The breakdown voltage may be specified with the third electrode open, shorted or biased to another electrode. Secondary Breakdown High voltages and currents passing through a transistor cause current to be concentrated or focused on a very small area of the transistor chip causing localized overheating. This is important in power transistors which are often designed to minimize this effect. Saturation Voltage (Vcesat) For a given base current, the collector-emitter saturation voltage is the potential across this junction while the transistor is in conduction. A further increase in the bias does not increase the collector current. Saturation voltage is very important in switching and power transistors. It is usually in the order of 0.1v to 1.0v Safe-operating-area Power transistors are often required to work at high currents and high voltages simultaneously. This ability is shown in a safe operating area curve. PTOT The total package power dissipation VCBO The dc voltage between the collector terminal and the base terminal when the emitter terminal is open-circuited. VCEO The dc voltage between the collector terminal and the emitter terminal when the base terminal is open-circuited. BC547-9 (BC107-9) NPN BC557-9 (BC557-9) PNP Low frequency, general purpose small signal transistors widely used in audio, switching and television circuits. The BC547-9 series and BC557-9 series are functionally identical to the common BC107-9 series. All have a maximum power dissipation of 500mW. They have essentially similar specifications and can generally be substituted for one another (within the PNP and NPN groups of three each). All devices are housed in standard TO-92 plastic packages.

Any relay with an operating current of less than 60mA and operating voltage of less than 12v is suitable. The circuit\'s supply rail should be at least 3v higher than the operating voltage of the relay. The circuit will work with any relay with a coil resistance higher than 180 ohms and a pull in voltage of less than 12v. FM transmitter This circuit, is about as simple as a transmitter can get. The coil is etched onto the printed circuit board, but can be easily substituted by 6 turns on a 4mm diameter former. Multivibrator- Morse Code Generator This circuit is an astable multivibrator or square-wave generator. The circuit is suitable as a morse code generator. The frequency of operation can be raised by making the value of the capacitors smaller. The speaker can be any general purpose 8 ohm type. BD139/140 Driver Transistors BD139/140 are complementary silicon driver transistors designed for audio and switching applications. They come in TO-126 plastic cases. The BD139 is an NPN device and the BD140 is PNP. Features  High gain (hFE40-250)  High fT (250MHz for BD139, 75MHz for BD140) Basic Amplifier 2N3055 Power Transistor The 2N3055 is a medium speed NPN Silicon Power Transistor designed for general purpose switching and amplifier applications. Features  DC current Gain (hFE) = 20-70 @ lc = 4.0A  Collector-Emitter Saturation Voltage = 1.0V @ lc = 4.0A Low Ripple Regulated Power Supply The excellent characteristics of the 2N3055 at high currents (high hFE and low collector-emitter saturation voltage) makes it ideal as a series regulator transistor in regulated power supplies. The power supply circuit shown below can be used when high current with low ripple is required. Q, and Q2 form a high power Darlington. ZD1 and R1 provide a reference voltage at the base of Q1 The voltage output will be:- VOUT = Zener Voltage - 1.2v Car Voltage Converter for radios and cassettes This circuit is suitable for dropping a 12v car battery to the correct voltage to run portable cassette players/radios etc. Using a 2N3055 might seem like a bit of an overkill but they are cheap. The output voltage will be 0.7v lower than the zener voltage, due to the voltage drop across the base-emitter junction of the 2N3055. The 10 ohm series resistor stops excessive current being drawn in the case of a short. The diode (1N4001) protects the transistor in case of reverse voltage being applied. The output will drive transistor radios, cassette players etc. If the current drain is over 500mA, it is a good idea to put a heat sink on Q1. Mounting the converter in a metal box with Q1 on the lid (but insulated from it with a mica washer) will act as a good heatsink. 2N2646 Unijunction transistor The 2N2646 is intended for general and industrial triggering and oscillator circuits where circuit economy is of primary importance. lt is a high speed switching device with a low saturation voltage.

Base-one (B1 and Base-two (B2). Between B, and B2 the UJT has a resistance of from 4.7k to 9.1k. In operation the UJT emitter voltage VE is lower than the emitter peak voltage VI. The emitter will be reverse biased and only a small leakage current will flow. When VE equals VI the emitter current will increase enormously. At the same time the emitter-B1 resistance will fail to a very low level. Basic UJT Pulse Trigger Circuit This is a basic relaxation oscillator. C charges through R, until the emitter reaches VP at which time the UJT turns on and discharges C1 via RB1. When the emitter has dropped to approximately 2v, the emitter stops conducting and the cycle starts again. The design of the UJT trigger is very broad. RB1 is limited to values below 100 ohms for most applications. R1 should be a value between 3k and 3M. Supply voltage can be from 10 to 35v. If the circuit is being used to trigger an SCR, RB1 must be low enough to prevent DC voltage at the gate from exceeding the maximum voltage that will not trigger the SCR. In practice, keep RB, below 50 ohms. The 2N2646 is specifically designed for SCR trigger circuits. RB2 is typically 100 ohms. UJT/SCR Time Delay Relay This circuit provides an efficient, high power and accurate time delay circuit. The SCR should be selected to suit the application. R5 and the zener diode maintain a stable supply for the UJT. Initially the SCR is off. The timing sequence is started by shorting out C1. C1 then charges through R1 and R2 until the UJT triggers, developing a pulse across R4 which turns on the SCR. Holding current for the SCR is supplied by current through R5 and D2. When the SCR triggers, it pulls the voltage across the UJT to <2 volts. This discharges C1. The load this circuit will drive depends on the SCR used. A suitable type would be a C106Y. This has a maximum current rating of 4A. This would be enough to drive a relay (even one with a low coil resistance), globes or an electric bell. Metronome This is the simplest metronome circuit. It produces a \'click\' similar to that of the traditional mechanical device. The rate is variable from 40 to 220 beats per minute. R1 sets the high rate limit and R2 the low rate limit. Virtually any speaker is suitable. Supply voltage is from 12 to 18v. While an 8 ohm speaker is suitable in this circuit, more volume and higher efficiency can be obtained with a high impedance speaker, such as a 40 ohm unit. MPF102, 5, 6 Field Effect Transistors The MPF102-6 series are N-channel Junction-type field effect transistors. The FET is a three terminal semiconductor device. Input voltage is applied to a GATE terminal and controls the current flowing from SOURCE to DRAIN terminals. An important feature of the FET is its very high input impedance. Since the FET makes use of a small input voltage to control a large output current, its gain is specified in terms of TRANSCONDUCTANCE. Transconductance (gfs) is equal to the change in drain current (dI0) divided by the change in gate voltage (dVG) and the formula is usually written as follows:- gfs = 100Q(dlD/dVG) where: gfs is the transconductance in micromhos ID is the drain current in DC mA VG is the gate/source voltage in DC volts. Definitions of specifications VGS (Gate/Source Voltage) This is the maximum voltage which may appear between gate and source. IDSS (Drain current at zero gale voltage) This is the current which will flow in the drain/source circuit when VGS = 0. It is given for specific drain/source voltages. BVGSS (Gate/Source breakdown voltage) The voltage at which the gate junction of a JFET will enter avalanche. Vp (Gate/Source pinchoff voltage) This is the gate-to-source voltage at which the field just closes the conduction channel. This is given for a specified value of VDS. The value of the drain current is specified (usually 1µA).

Operation and Applications The basic mode of operation of the FET amplifier is shown below. This is referred to as the common source amplifier. The gate to source circuit is the input and the drain to source circuit is the output. When a moderate reverse or negative voltage is applied between gate and source, the gate junction becomes \'reverse biased\' i.e. the voltage on the gate reduced the current flowing between the source and the drain. At a higher gate-source voltage, the drain-source current is cut to practically zero. This is referred to as the gate-source pinchoff voltage and is listed in the specifications as VP at a drain-source current of either 1 or 10uA. In practical circuits, the DC bias is developed across R2, due to the current being through it. This then puts the source at a positive potential relative to ground. The gate is at ground potential and therefore is at a negative potential relative to the source, R, sets the input impedance of the circuit since the gate of the FET draws virtually no current at all and so is seen by the load as a very high impedance. *NOTE All the circuits and applications in these pages assumes the use of \'N-channel\' Junction FETs, i.e. FETs in which the drain-source material is made of N-type silicon. However, these JFETs may be replaced in the circuits with P-channel JFETs if the polarity of the power supply is reversed. Typical Design for a Common-Source Circuit When used as an amplifier, the FET is biased to a certain part of its response curve for lowest distortion and maximum available voltage swing. Assume that the FET has the following operating parameters  VDs = 8V (where VDs is the voltage between drain and source)  ID = 0.5mA (where ID is the drain current) VGS = -2V (where VGS is the gate-drain voltage or bias) The power supply voltage is 22.5v FET Applications Source Follower Circuit: The source follower circuit is suitable where a high input impedance and low output impedance is required, but no voltage gain is needed. The figure below shows a typical source follower stage. Input impedance is set by the gate resistor RG. Output impedance is very low. RF Preselector The uses for the FET are not limited to audio applications. The circuit below is for an RF preselector (a tuned amplifier) for the broadcast bands. The FET is a very good device to use in this application, due to its low cross modulation characteristics. Most cheaper receivers use ordinary bipolar transistors to keep costs down. The FET RF amplifier can also take higher signal levels without distortion. The preselector has a Volume Control style gain control between the FET and the emitter follower output stage. This means that only the FET has to handle high signal levels. The tuning capacitor does not have to be exactly the same value as shown in the circuit, any capacitor covering a similar range is suitable. The aerial coil is wound on a 200mm length of ferrite rod. The main winding consists of 42 turns of 22B&S enamelled wire. The second winding consists of a further 6 turns. The preselector gives a marked improvement on the reception of weak signals and aids in the attenuation of adjacent channel interference and noise. LDR Applications Light Beam Relay In this circuit the LDR is held at a low resistance by light from a small globe. The circuit is actuated when the beam is broken. The resistance of the LDR then goes high. The circuit is set up so that with the light shining on the LDR the input voltages at the two input terminals of the 741 op amp hold its output \'low\'. When the LDR goes to high resistance the op amp\'s output goes \'high\'. This turns the transistor \'on\' and pulls in the relay. Simple timer The very high impedance of the FET makes it suitable for a wide variety of timer circuits. The circuit below gives one such example. With C1 given a value of 1µF, it will give timing periods of 40 sec, and with a value of 100µF it gives a period of 35 minutes. The FET is wired as a source follower and has its gate taken to the junction of a time constant network R1-C1 When the supply is first connected, C1 is discharged, so Q1 gate is at ground potential, and the source is a volt or two higher. The base of Q1 is connected to the source of Q1 via R3, so Q2 is turned on and 12v is across R5, When the supply is connected, C1 starts to charge via R1, so the voltages on the gate of Q1 (and on the source) rise exponentially towards the 12v supply. When the voltage reaches approximately 10.5v the bias on Q1 falls to zero and Q2 switches off, the voltage across R5 falls to zero. FET Voltmeter The very high input impedance of the FET makes it the ideal basis of a voltmeter. The circuit below has a basic sensitivity of 22M ohms per volt. Maximum full scale sensitivity is 0.5V, and input sensitivity is a constant 11.1 M ohms on all ranges. R7,R8 R9 form a potential divider across the 12v supply. R8 is adjusted for a zero meter deflection. Any potential across the gate circuit of Q1 causes the circuit to \'unbalance\'. To avoid drift, the power supply should be stabilized if possible. 555 Light Switch The use of the 555 timer 1C with an LDR provides a high performance light switch. An LDR is a Light Dependent Resistor and is a very low cost way of detecting light. The 555 is used with its trigger and thresholds tied together to provide a Schmitt trigger with a very low input current but which can drive a relay taking up to 200mA of current. The trigger is activated when the light level on the LDR falls below a predetermined level. The relay energizes when the voltage on pins 2 and 6 is greater than 2/3Vcc. It de-energizes when the voltage falls below 1/3VCC. This gives a hysteresis of 1/3VCC. The 555 can supply current up to 200mA, so the relay type is not critical. Any with a coil resistance from 100-280 ohms would be suitable. Light Sensitive Switch This circuit makes use of the wide change of resistance of the LDR. Between positive and negative supply there is a voltage divider. The bottom section is a variable resistor RV1. The top half is formed by the LDR and a 4.7K ohm resistor in series. In low light conditions when the resistance of the LDR is very high, the bias to the Darlington pair formed by TR1 and TR2 is very low, and they do not conduct. When the light level rises, the resistance of the LDR falls. This turns the transistors \'on\' and pulls in the relay. The LDR should be an ORP12 or similar. The relay should have a pull in voltage of 9V or lower and a coil resistance of 280 ohms or higher. Photo Electric Relay This circuit is basically a bistable multivibrator. When the light level is low and the resistance of the ORP12 is high, transistor Q1 conducts and Q2 is off. As the level of illumination increases the resistance drops until Q1 cuts off and Q2 turns on, energizing the relay coil. The relay should have a coil resistance of 180 ohms or higher and a pull in voltage of 9V or lower LEDs Features  Low power consumption  IC compatible  Long life Absolute Maximum Ratings Red Green Yellow Amber Orange Reverse Voltage 5v 5v 5v 5v 5v Av forward Current 20mA 30mA 30mA 30mA 30mA Peak Forward Current 200mA 200mA 200mA 200mA 200mA Power Dissipation 100mW 100mW 100mW 100mW 100mW LED Basics LEDs are used in the \'forward biased\' mode. i.e. positive on the anode and negative on the cathode. This voltage drop is stated in the specifications (eg 1.7V for a red LED), If the LED is used on a higher voltage than this, a current limiting resistor must be used. The following formula can be used:- R = (E -1.7) x 1000/I R is the resistance in ohms. E is the DC supply voltage. I is the LED current in milliamps. A common LED current is 20mA. Some calculated values are:- For 6v use 220 ohm. For 9v use 390 ohm. For 12v use 560 ohm. For 24v use 1.2k ohm. If a LED is reverse biased, it will break down, in a similar way to a zener diode. This occurs at 3-5V. It usually damages the diode if a high current flows. Operating LEDs from the mains This circuit uses a capacitor as a voltage dropping element. A 1N4148 diode is placed across the LED for rectification. As the voltage across the LED is negligible compared with the supply, capacitor current is almost exactly equal to mains voltage divided by the capacitor reactance. At 50Hz, a 0.47µF will result in a LED current of about 16mA. Resistor Rs limits current on transients. A value of 270 ohms is adequate. The Flashing LED The Flashing LED has a chip inside the device to produce the flash-rate. Simply connect the LED to a supply voltage (4v to 10v) and the LED will flash at a rate of approx 2Hz. No external resistor is needed up to 10v. For voltages higher than 10v, the resistor should be 100 ohms for each volt above 10v. This is the only LED that does not need a resistor when connected to a supply as it has an internal resistor. All other LEDs MUST have a resistor in series to limit the current and prevent damage. LED Flasher This circuit for a LED flasher is very simple and cheap to make and will work on any voltage between 3v and 12v. As the voltage is raised the value of R1 must be increased - The speed can be changed by altering the value of C1 and C2 and/or R2 or R3. Raising the value of C1 and C2 slows the rate down. Raising the value of R2 and R3 also slows it down. LED Chaser This circuit acts as a LED chaser. The 4017 is driven by a 555 working as a free-running multivibrator. The speed can be changed by altering C1 or R1. CQY89 Light Emitting Diode - Infrared LED The CQY89 is an infrared LED, similar in performance to conventional LEDs, but emitting light in the infrared region. This is visible to the human eye. Unlike conventional LEDs, infrared LEDs are usually pulsed rather than fed with continuous DC. They find wide use in alarms and in remote control equipment.

It is wired so that a current is generated that is proportional to the light falling on it. The FET acts as a source follower and impedance matches to the next stage. The amplifier after this acts as a bandpass filter. Its output is coupled to a CMOS Schmitt trigger, followed by a rectifying circuit and a pulse stretcher. This drives a transistor and a buzzer and LED. Transmitter A CMOS oscillator drives an output stage consisting of a BC547 transistor and two CQY89 infrared LEDs. Current drive is limited by the 680 ohm resistor. If greater range is required, this resistor may be reduced to a minimum of 150 ohms with a consequent increase in current consumption. 7 Segment LED Displays The 7 segment display is found in many displays such as microwaves, lifts, ovens etc. It consists of 7 LEDs that have been combined into one case to make a convenient device for displaying numbers and some letters. There are basically two different size displays. 0.3 and 0.5. The two sizes are shown below: Displays come is a range of colours and brightness levels. Most come in super-bright and these are preferred so the display can be seen during the day. They are not much more expensive but give a much better illumination. All displays also come in COMMON CATHODE and COMMON ANODE. The COMMON CATHODE display has all the cathodes of the LEDs tied together and connects to the pin that goes to the 0v rail. This is the most common type of display. The Common Cathode and Common Anode displays are wired as shown below: The project above from JJM turns on each segment of the display to show how each letter and number is produced. The second photo is a white 7-segment display. Electronic Die This circuit consists of three sections: an oscillator, a counter, and the display. The oscillator uses three sections of a 4069 hex inverter. The 4029 is a four bit counter with the capacity to count from zero to 15. The 4511 driver/decoder takes binary output and decodes it to drive a seven segment display. The current to the 7-segmenl display is limited by seven 560 ohm resistors. The display is a common cathode type, and any 7-segment display can be used. Counter This circuit uses a 7-segment display as the output of a basic counter circuit. The 7490 counts decimal pulses and converts them to a BCD code. Its output is fed to a 7475 latch. This stores the outputs from the decade counter. The four binary outputs are taken from the 7475 to a 7447 LCD to the 7 segment LED decoder, which drives the display. THE UNIJUNCTION TRANSISTOR SC151D TRIAC The SC151 D is a medium power plastic package TRIAC designed for economical mains power and lighting control. Unlike SCRs, the SCI 51 D is a bidirectional thyristor - when triggered, it conducts in both directions and can be triggered by a positive or negative gate signal. TRIAC (Triode AC Semiconductor). The diagram below shows the V/l characteristics of the Triac. A gate current of the specified level of either polarity will trigger the triac into conduction in either quadrant, provided the applied voltage is less than VB0. Triggering may be from DC, rectified AC or pulse sources such as unijunctions, neon lamps or breakdown devices such as the ST4. Specifications Voltage Rating 400V Current Rating 15A RMS ITSM Maximum peak one cycle non rep. surge current 110A IDRM Blocking Current at 25°C 0.1mA max dv/dt Off State, Tc = 100°C, Rated VDRM, gate O/C 250V/µS (typ.) FIRING IGT Max DC Gate Trigger current VD=12v, 25°C 50mA VGT Max Gate Trigger voltage VD= 12v 25°C 2.5V Triac as a switch This gives improved performance over a conventional switch, as there can be no arcing or contact bounce. This circuit shows a simple three position power control. In position one there is no gate connection, so power is off. In position two there is gate current during one half cycle only and load power is half wave. In position three the gate is triggered on both half cycles and the power is full on. For a simple on-off switch, just delete the diode. Because the contacts only carry current for the few microseconds needed to trigger the triac, the actual switch can be almost any small device: reed relays, thermostats, pressure switches or program/timer switches. Lamp dimmer/Heater controller R1 and C1 are a phase shift network - they produce a variable delay in the waveform applied to the ST4 and hence the triac. When the voltage across C1 reaches the breakdown voltage for the ST4, C1 partially discharges into the triac gate through the ST4. This pulse triggers the triac into conduction for the remainder of the half cycle. This easy-to-build controller is ideal for dimming lights, and controlling the output of electric heating type appliances. The light or heater element etc is placed where the \'LOAD\' is marked on the circuit. ST4 Asymmetrical AC Trigger Switch The ST4 is an integrated triac trigger circuit that provides wide range hysteresis-free control of voltage. It behaves like a zener diode in series with a silicon bilateral switch (a symmetrical device). The zener provides asymmetry since the switching voltage is increased in one direction by the zener breakdown voltage. Switching voltage: VS1 14v-18v VS2 7-9v Switching current I S1 I S2 80µA On-state voltages VF1 (I = 100mA) 7-10v VF2 (I = 100mA) 1.6v max Peak pulse voltage V0 3.5v min C122D/C122E Silicon Control Rectifier The C122Dand 122E are medium power plastic package SCRs designed chiefly for mains power and motor control. The SCR is a unidirectional device, (current flows through it in one direction, from anode to cathode). The SCR is a three terminal semiconductor device. The three terminals are the anode (A), cathode (K). and the gate (G). With no voltage applied to the gate terminal, if a voltage is applied to the SCR anode and cathode terminals, (anode positive with respect to cathode) current flow is prohibited. If the supply is reversed the flow is likewise prohibited. Thus with no signal applied, the SCR appears as an open circuit as long as its diode junctions do not break down. The SCR is brought into conduction by applying a current into the gate terminal. This will cause it to conduct in the forward direction (i.e. with the anode positive and the cathode negative). The gate voltages required vary from approximately 1.5- 6.0v. Once the SCR is turned on the gate no longer controls the circuit and the SCR only drops out of conduction when the anode-cathode voltage falls to near zero. At this instant, the current through the device falls to zero. Specifications C122E VDRM (Repetitive off state voltage. Max between anode and cathode) 500V IT (RMS Current through SCR) 8 Amps IGT (Peak Positive gate current) (Tc = 25°C) 25mA VGT (Peak Positive gate voltage) (Tc = 25°C) 1.5V PG (AV) (Max Gate power) 0.5W IH Holding Current (Current below which the SCR will drop out of conduction) (Tc = 25°C) 30mA dv/dt Rate of change of on-state voltage (Max. rate of change of anode-cathode voltage which will not turn SCR on) 50V/µsec(typ.) The C122D differs only in that its VDRM is only 400v as against 500v for the C122E. The SCRs listed above are medium power SCRs (Silicon Controlled Rectifiers) designed primarily for economical mains power and motor control. They are three terminal devices (see above). The electrodes are anode, cathode and control gate. They are unidirectional devices i.e when triggered \'on\' they only conduct in one direction. The SCR is a \'regenerative\' device. It is triggered \'on\' by injecting a signal into the gate. As noted earlier, once the gate has triggered the SCR \'on\' it no longer controls the gate. The only way to cause the SCR to stop conducting from cathode to anode is to drop the anode cathode voltage to a level where the current flowing from anode to cathode is below the \'holding level\'. This is indicated in the figure above. In practice, this is not a problem, since SCRs are normally used to control fluctuating voltages such as the AC mains. The \'drop out\' of the SCR occurs as the mains voltage goes through zero. Applications SCRs are current rather than voltage triggered devices. This means that they must be fed from a relatively low impedance source i.e. one in which the voltage won\'t drop down under load from the gate. In a way analogous to a relay or a solenoid, the SCR requires certain minimum anode current if it is to remain in the \'closed\' or conducting state. If the anode current drops below the minimum level, the SCR reverts to the forward blocking or \'open\' state. The following circuit shows a basic R-C-Diode trigger circuit giving full half wave control. On positive half cycles the capacitor C will charge to the trigger point, at a speed determined by the time constant of R and C. On the negative half cycle, the capacitor is reset by CR2, resetting it for tire next charging cycle, Thus the triggering current is supplied by the line voltage. C122D, C122E, C106D SCRs Phase Control Circuit Improved phase control circuit The following diagram shows a circuit using a neon lamp as a breakdown device. This gives smoother control and improved performance. The neon triggers when the voltage across the two 0.1µ capacitors reaches the breakdown voltage of the lamp (60-90V). Control extends from 95% to full off. The neon lamp phase controlled circuit shown below combines the low cost of the simple RC circuit shown before but gives improved performance. The circuit below gives half wave control from 95% on to full off. Full power can be easily obtained by putting a switch across the SCR. The circuit uses a neon. This gives the following improvements: A higher impedance circuit can be used for control. As a result, the control element (which is a 100k pot in the circuit below) can be replaced by a high impedance device such as a thermistor or light dependent resistor, for heating or light control applications. OP-AMP Basics The op-amp is a very high gain DC amplifier. This is quoted in specifications as typically in the range of 20,000 to 100,000 times. The symbol for the op-amp is shown below. As can be seen, there are two inputs, the inverting and the non-inverting. If a signal is applied to the -input (inverting) with the + input (non-inverting) grounded, the polarity of the output signal will be opposite that of the input. If the signal is applied to the + input with the - input grounded, the polarity of the output signal will be the same as the input signal. For an AC signal, this means that when it is applied to the - input, the output signal will be 180° out of phase with the input. If the same signal is applied to both the + and - inputs, the two signals will cancel each other out. The op-amp responds to the difference between its two inputs - hence the name differential amplifier. The ability of an op-amp to cancel two equal signals at its pins is referred to as its common-mode rejection. The most common op-amp circuit is shown below and uses two external components; 1) an input component, R1 2) a feedback component, RF. When the feedback component is between the op-amp output and the negative input the op-amp is said to have negative feedback. When the feedback component is between the op-amp output and the positive input, the circuit is said to have positive feedback. With no feedback applied, the gain is set by the op-amp itself and is very high (at very low frequencies). This is referred to as the open loop gain. When negative feedback is applied, the gain is specified by the feedback components, and is referred to as the \'closed loop gain\'. Gain = Rf / Ri Thus to produce an amplifier with a gain of 100, we can use an input resistor of 1k and a feedback resistor of 100k. This is shown below with the op-amp connected as an inverting amplifier. To produce a non-inverting amplifier, the signal is applied to the non-inverting input and the feedback components are left on the non-inverting side. This is shown following. Output Offset The steady state output of an op-amp with negative feedback is zero when the input is zero. The actual DC output (in a real op-amp) is usually not quite zero, and this small unwanted signal is usually referred to as the output offset voltage. Most op-amps have means of nulling this out. Fig A shows the most common method, where the op-amp has special nulling pins. If these are not available, the method in Fig B can be used. Frequency Compensation Circuits using op-amps must be designed so that the open loop gain of the op-amp itself is greater than the closed loop gain of the circuit for all frequencies of operation. The gain drops as the frequency increases. This is mainly due to the large amounts of internal \'compensation\' used to make sure that they do not oscillate. Frequency compensation is the shaping of the frequency responses of the op-amp so that it does not oscillate due to internal phase shift. This phase shift acts as a time delay. When this delay is great enough so that the input signal is delayed 360° (a complete cycle), the amplifier will oscillate. This is because the \'negative feedback\' signal, instead of being in opposition to the input signal will actually reinforce it. Thus the input signal keeps getting bigger and bigger - positive feedback occurs.

The person at Radio Mundial (Ramesh) on being questioned said that servicing and other complaints are handled by Customer Care (1800-266-8282 and 1800-3000-8282). The AC worked well until about 2.5 weeks when it just refused to cool. Everything comes on as usual, but no cooling. The temperature level moves up and down via the remote, but no change in cooling. Whatever the problem, service technicians should be able to rectify it but the problem is calling on both the above-provided helpline numbers direct me to a call center most probably.... The person at the other end of the phone.......identifies the caller....updates the personal data.....puts the caller on HOLD....thanks for HOLDING the line..........comes up with EXCUSES............promises the matter being looked into.......SAYS.......the complaint has been FORWARDED to the respective SERVICE CENTER....and DISCONNECTS. I waited for the technician to come on the day promised..........NO ONE EVEN CALLED........Still, I waited another day....I called again. This time, on the second number...........The same process was repeated........Again, I wait..........NOTHING happens. So, here I am, writing a complaint. This Happens Only in INDIA. This is really BAD SERVICE on the part of SAMSUNG. And going through the various complaints highlighted on the complaint board, one fails to understand how a company so great as this can just decide to ignore a complaint however small it may seem to them, to the customer every problem is a BIG one.

Yesterday while coming from School he tried to catch the 240 Bus at Mount Poisar church stop on 1.20pm from front gate with his friends due to rush on back door/gate. But driver & TC, who is sitting inside not allowed them to do so & asked them to go from back side gate. So all students get down & went back to catch the bus, till that time driver started the bus & run away without taking this students. By catching running bus students can be fallen down & injured. My son forgot to note down bus number. You are requested to take serious action against this driver & TC to avoid this type of incidence in future. Inside seated TC also not did anything. Please do the needful & inform us the course of action.
