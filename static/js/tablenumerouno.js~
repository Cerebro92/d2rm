My Airtel phone ref is 044-45516271. Hope my complaint would taken seriously and the issue would addressed. I was a Airtel customer from the year since it started its service and I had a very high regard on this organisation but on receipt of the gift of this sort, all my regards and the image of Airtel has diminished.

Within a day of usage, the sole had a crack and was breaking off from the shoe.I returned the shoe to the store on 4th of August and asked for a replacement or refund. The store promised to get me a replacement in a week. On checking next week I was told that they did not get a stock of the shoe from their store office. After checking with them again after 2-3 weeks, the store owner told that this particular model has some manufacturing defect and suggested replacement once the new stock comes. Now its been more than a month and half and the store still does not have any new stock. I want to log a complaint against the store owners for not refunding my amount nor replacing my shoe on my repeated requests. Please help.

But it just doesn\'t work. Site starts working properly around 08:30 but by that time all the tickets are gone. I think it is a deliberate attempt to slow down the server so that Agents can work with Reservation counters and make more money. The person at the reservation counter also gets his cut. So no wonder then that, if you pay 500/- per ticket extra to the travel agent, he\'ll get you the tatkal tickets. On top of it, IRCTC has stopped the tatkal services till 09:00 am from all the third party providers like NGPAY, Cleartrip. And these guys run much faster than IRCTC. To me it looks like a scam.

First i had to follow for my shoe on 10 days regularly basis. Now in three months shoe cloth has badly damaged only for 1 hr walking. Now in my mind likely a reason either a shoe is original reebok or not. because original shoe have never gives that kind of response. Also they provide 1 year warranty or 6 months warranty. Now as per bag it today costumer support they refused to give any repairing or replacement. Now i want to ask why they cheater selling products with taking the brand name. Now it has become their habits to make people fool. Also they do not understand the value of customer.
