But of you are in Gurgaon or nearby, this water park can be visited once.</td><td>funNfood</td><td>Rides</td><td>Negative</td></tr><tr><td>Pathetic is the word!! No or very less safety procedures and it seems no-one is interested in maintenance of rides. Will not visit here again</td><td>funNfood</td><td>Services</td><td>Negative</td></tr><tr><td>I am a criminal lawyer and today I visited fun and food gurgaon with my 7 year old kid. I found water parks nice but availability of food was not good. The most shocking thing occurred when I went to see the movie show nd unfortunately i was the only one present with my kid at that time to watch the movie. The man there literally locked me into that room with three other men on pretext of watching the movie, I somehow tricked the man saying that I forgot to purchase the ticket. The movie area is at a place aloof from main water park. I will never recommend women to go there alonw with kids and took up the issue with management. Beware. Otherwise, the area around pool is safe and secure. Security issues loom large. Life guards are inadequate keeping in lieu the number of people visiting it.</td><td>funNfood</td><td>Services</td><td>Negative</td></tr><tr><td>Very dirty, very unhygienic, staff is rude, full of hooligans. Very crowded, you hardly get a chance to use same ride again.

I visited this place for the first time and really found it much more than my expectations. The place have all the ingredients to keep people, specially the kids, fully occupied.

Lot of lockers and quite big and well maintained change rooms. I liked the pool with waves. No entry fee for senior citizens so another reason to take your parents along with you.
