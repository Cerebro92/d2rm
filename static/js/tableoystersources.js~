I found water parks nice but availability of Food was not good. The most shocking thing occurred when I went to see the movie show nd unfortunately i was the only one present with my kid at that time to watch the movie. The man there literally locked me into that room with three other men on pretext of watching the movie, I somehow tricked the man saying that I forgot to purchase the ticket. The movie area is at a place aloof from main water park. I will never recommend women to go there alonw with kids and took up the issue with management. Beware. Otherwise, the area around pool is safe and secure. Security issues loom large.
